I probably made it a lot harder than it had to be by insisting on the use of array, but i am glad i did it. 
It allowed me to delve a little deeper into array's and i had to learn how to google exactly what i needed to know.
figuring out how to store the input in the array was one thing, but working out how to split the array into 2 numbers and an operator was a real challenge, even more so give that i allowed . to be used. (But only once).

some key lessons:
- You can not attach listeners to a group of items, you have to use forEach.
- !*something* means not. So !item means not that item
- an IF statement doesn't need to have an else cause if you only want to perform an action in case of if
- I need to learn more about {}
- How to add keyboard support. NOt hard though.
